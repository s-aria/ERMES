# ERMES
ERMES (Electric Regularized Maxwell Equations with Singularities) is a finite element (FEM) code in frequency domain. It is the C++ implementation of a FEM formulation based on the regularized Maxwell equations. It is able to calculate electromagnetic fields for several applications: microwave engineering, antenna design, eddy currents, electromagnetic metal forming. ERMES results have been collated with experimental measurements and also with different numerical methods (MoM, FDTD). ERMES has a user-friendly interface based on GiD, which is used as pre- and post- processor. Versions for Windows x-32 and x-64 are available.
